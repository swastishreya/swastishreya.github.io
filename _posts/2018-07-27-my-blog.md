## Why blog ?

I've been told several times that I'm not good at expressing myself. My friends and professors tell me that my ideas are usually good but I don't explain them properly. Voil√†! That's where blogging comes into picture.

This blog isn't meant to attract readers, I'm doing this for self improvement and my own satisfaction. When I start writing the blog, about my code, it helps me gain a new perspective and I start explaining "myself" better. I take time to think about how to put my idea correctly. The blog also helps me decide the flow of the write up for better reception of the idea.

Sometimes a new idea pops up in my mind after I start writing the blog. Generally, I try to dry run the code in my head to explain it in the blog, that's when I encounter the bugs in my code and correct them.

Blogging helps us think not only how we will present the idea but also how others might perceive it. Blogging regularly can help our mind to picture our ideas clearly. Making this a habit is quite an achievement.
