Hey! This is Swasti. I'm currently studying at IIIT Bangalore.
I enjoy coding, painting and dancing. I decided to create this 
blog because in my field (Computer Science Engineering :P) we
come across cool stuff everyday and I wanted to share it with you
guys too.

You can take a look at my github profile [here](https://github.com/swastishreya).

Painting and sketching is my favourite time pass. If you like it
do check out my [instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/swasti.draws/).

Thanks a lot! Feel free to [contact](https://www.facebook.com/swastis.mishra.7) me.
