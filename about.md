##SWASTI SHREYA MISHRA

Hey! This is Swasti. I'm currently studying at IIIT Bangalore, India. I'm in my 2nd year of Integrated M.Tech course in Computer Science Engineering (B.Tech + M.Tech). I enjoy coding, painting and dancing. I decided to create this blog because in my field we come across cool stuff everyday and I wanted to share it with everyone.
